Kandula
#######

Kandula is a Python package for general Reinforcement Learning (RL). It can be used to train an RL agent for any problem that can be mapped to RL.

Usage
#####

.. code:: bash

    pip install kandula


If the problem at hand can be satisfy main RL requirements, then
it can be solved via RL and hence Kandula can be hte right solution. Otherwise, other approaches in ML might be more applicable.

To solve your problem via RL, you should be able to define a **state space**, a set of **actions**, and a **reward function** such that the actions change
the state of the problem and the reward function assigns a reward to each action.
